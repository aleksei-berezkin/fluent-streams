/**
 * A stream is a thin wrapper over iterable, providing intermediate and terminal operations to manipulate data.
 * Like iterables, streams respect items order; if not specified explicitly, operations consume and transform items
 * in the original order. Streams are lazy: all computations are triggered only on terminal operations.
 * 
 * Stream can be explained as a function over an iterable. Intermediate operations return new functions containing
 * current stream as an input; terminal operations capture input, evaluate functions chain and return data.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * stream(1, 2, 3, 4)       // factory
 *   .filter(i => i%2===0)  // intermediate
 *   .map(i => -i)          // intermediate
 *   .toArray()             // terminal => [-2, -4]
 * ```
 * 
 * Streams are stateless: they don't store anything except reference to an input. This means streams may be iterated
 * multiple times, and each time the stream is evaluated against input as it was on the moment of invoking terminal
 * operation.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * const input = [10, 20, 30]
 * const s = stream(input)
 *   .map(i => i + 1)
 * s.toArray()   // => [11, 21, 31]
 *   
 * input.push(40)
 * s.toArray()   // => [11, 21, 31, 41]
 * ```
 * 
 * During evaluation streams produce as little intermediate data as possible. For example, {@link map} does
 * not copy input data; instead, it retrieves upstream data one by one, and pushes mapped items downstream also
 * value by value. Some operations do require creating intermediate data structures, for example {@link shuffle}
 * and {@link sortBy}; in this case downstream steps maximize the benefit of having random-access array allowed
 * for modifications.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * stream(30, 20, 10, 0)
 *     .map(i => i + 1) // does not copy data, maps on evaluation
 *     .sortBy(i => i)  // copies data to the new array and sorts it
 *     .at(2)           // makes a[2] on array created upstream
 *     .get()           // => 21
 * ```
 * 
 * @typeParam T Input elements type
